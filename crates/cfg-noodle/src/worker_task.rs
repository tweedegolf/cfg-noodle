/// A default worker task that manages storage operations based on read/write signals.
///
/// This worker task continuously monitors for read and write signals from the storage list
/// and performs the appropriate operations when triggered. It implements a debouncing mechanism
/// to avoid excessive operations when multiple signals occur in quick succession.
///
/// This implementation may be used when very basic logic is sufficient to handle reading and writing.
/// If more sophisticated logic is required, you can implement your own worker task and trigger
/// reads and writes as appropriate for your application.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `list` - A static reference to the storage list
/// * `flash` - The flash storage implementation used for persistent storage
/// * `stopper` - When this future completes, an immediate write is triggered and the worker task returns.
///   Usually this is some sort of signal's or waiter's `wait()` function
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// The task operates in a loop, waiting for either:
/// - Read signals: Triggers after 100ms of no new read signals, then processes reads.
///   After the first read operation, it also performs garbage collection after a 120-second delay.
/// - Write signals: Triggers after 10 seconds of no new write signals, then processes writes
///   followed by garbage collection.
///
/// When the stopper future completes, the task attempts to flush any pending writes before
/// terminating. If garbage collection is needed during shutdown, it will be performed automatically.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Errors during storage operations are logged but do not cause the task to terminate.
/// The task will continue processing subsequent signals even if individual operations fail.
